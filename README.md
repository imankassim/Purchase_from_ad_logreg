# Purchase_from_ad_logreg

This dataset is from an company advertising their products (T-Shirts) online. 
The data shows whether or not a social media user who viewed the ad bought the product or not.

The data is stored in an Amazon S3 bucket - https://social-network-ads-dataset.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Social_Network_Ads.csv

This analysis can be used to focus ads on one specific group of people in order to keep costs down.

I will be using a logistic regession model for the classification - where the goal is to predict whether the user will purchase the item or not.
