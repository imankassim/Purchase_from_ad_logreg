# Purchase made after advertisement - Logistic Regression Model

This model uses company data based on social media activity to determine whether or not a customer will purchase a T-shirt or not after seeing an advertisement.

## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

The dataset is from a company advertising their T-shirts online, showing whether or not a social media user who viewed the ad also bought the product, or not.

This data is stored in an Amazon S3 Bucket - https://social-network-ads-dataset.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Social_Network_Ads.csv

### Installing

This model can be run in Google Colab, so no installation is necessary.
